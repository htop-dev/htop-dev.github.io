        %h1 htop in popular culture :-D
        %p
          To my complete amazement, htop has been featured in
          a few pieces of media over the years. It always makes
          my day when someone emails me telling they've spotted
          htop in a film or TV show.
        %p
          At Hugo Gualandi's suggestion, here's a page with some of
          these sightings.
          Please send an
          %a{:href => "mailinglist.html"} email
          notification if you find others - thanks!

          Finding Your Roots (2017), according to Wikipedia is "a documentary television
          series" on the American TV channel PBS. Amazingly, htop makes an appearance
          in an episode on Bernie Sanders and Larry David!

          (2015), TV series. It's clearly a Hollywood mockup and not the actual
          software, but it's pretty evident they were going for the htop look. :)
